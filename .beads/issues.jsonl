Start Simple selection via bridge. Single click starts selection, double-click starts Semantic (word), triple-click starts Lines.\n- mouseDragged: update selection endpoint, set needsRedraw.\n- mouseUp: finalize selection (keep it visible until next click or text input).\n- Coordinate conversion: pixel_x / cellWidth = col, pixel_y / cellHeight = row. Side = Left if within first half of cell, Right otherwise.\n- Track click count with timestamp-based detection (NSEvent.clickCount handles this).","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"task","owner":"alex.geana@erepubliklabs.com","created_at":"2026-02-04T17:38:10.380037+02:00","created_by":"Alexandru Geana","updated_at":"2026-02-04T17:47:18.663136+02:00","closed_at":"2026-02-04T17:47:18.663136+02:00","close_reason":"Mouse events for selection implemented","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"Claide-vpn","depends_on_id":"Claide-amh","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-02-04T17:38:51.25346+02:00","created_by":"Alexandru Geana"},{"issue_id":"Claide-vpn","depends_on_id":"Claide-fk7","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-02-04T17:38:51.343109+02:00","created_by":"Alexandru Geana"}]}
